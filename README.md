# Linker
This is a small custom Chrome Browser Extention with a simple layout. It enables you to store links at hand while doing research. I implemented solutions which are helpful in searching for information on the Internet and sharing it with others.

## Features
- storing links while switching browser tabs
- saving typed phrases inside an input field [press "Enter" or click "SAVE INPUT" button]
- preventing repeats (you can add only unique value)
- saving the URL of an active browser tab [click the "SAVE TAB" button]
- deleting all of the stored links [double click the "DELETE ALL" button]
- opening each stored link in a new browser tab [click the link]
- removing each link separately [click red "x" next to the link]
- copying the list of the stored links in a clipboard [click the "COPY" button]

## Overview

## Installation
1. Download the extension. [click "Code" button and select "Download ZIP"]
2. Extract the files into their own folder. Give the extension files a permanent home. Move this folder to a convenient place where you may not accidentally tidy them up or delete them later. 
3. In Chrome, navigate to:  **chrome://extensions/**
4. Drag and drop the extension folder from your file manager anywhere onto the extensions page in Chrome.
5. Done! The extension is installed and you are ready to go. You can now manage the extension as you would any other, and its icon will appear in the Chrome Menu to the right of the address bar.
