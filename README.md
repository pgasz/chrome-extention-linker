# Linker
This is small custom Chrome Browser Extention with simple layout. It is made for storing links at hand while doing research. I implemented solutions that I found helpful in searching for information on the Internet and sharing them with others.

## Features
- storing links while switching browser tags
- saving typed phrases inside input field [pressing "Enter" or clicking "SAVE INPUT" button]
- preventing repeats (you can add only unique value)
- saving the URL of active browser tag [clicking the "SAVE TAB" button]
- deleting all of the stored links [double clicking the "DELETE ALL" button]
- opening each stored link in new browser tag [clicking the link]
- remove each link separately [clicking red "x" next to the link]
- coping list of the stored links in clipboard [clicking the "COPY" button]
