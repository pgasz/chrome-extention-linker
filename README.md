# Linker
This is a small custom Chrome Browser Extention with a simple layout. It enables you to store links at hand while doing research. I implemented solutions which are helpful in searching for information on the Internet and sharing it with others.

## Features
- storing links while switching browser tags
- saving typed phrases inside an input field [pressing "Enter" or clicking "SAVE INPUT" button]
- preventing repeats (you can add only unique value)
- saving the URL of an active browser tab [clicking the "SAVE TAB" button]
- deleting all of the stored links [double clicking the "DELETE ALL" button]
- opening each stored link in a new browser tab [clicking the link]
- removing each link separately [clicking red "x" next to the link]
- copying the list of the stored links in a clipboard [clicking the "COPY" button]
